        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p> Steven Paul Jobs <span>(/dʒɒbz/; February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011)</span> was an American business
            magnate,
            industrial designer, investor, and media proprietor. He was the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO),
            and co-founder of Apple Inc., the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar, a member of The Walt
            Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar, and the founder, chairman, and
            CEO of NeXT. Jobs is widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and
            1980s, along with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. </p>

        <p> Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in <span>1976</span> to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together
            the duo
            gained fame and wealth a year later with the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced
            microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and
            had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in
            1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The
            Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter,
            the first laser printer to feature vector graphics. Jobs was forced out of Apple in <sapn>1985</sapn> after
            a long
            power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took a few
            of Apple's members with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in
            computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, he helped to develop the visual
            effects industry when he funded the computer graphics division of George Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986. The
            new company was Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer animated feature film Toy Story
            <Span>(1995)</Span>, and
            went on to become a major animation studio, producing over 20 films since then.
        </p>

        <p> Jobs became CEO of Apple in <span>1997</span>, following his company's acquisition of NeXT. He was largely
            responsible for helping revive Apple, which had been on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with
            designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning in
            1997 with the "Think different" advertising campaign and leading to the iMac, iTunes, iTunes Store,
            Apple Store, iPod, iPhone, App Store, and the iPad. In 2001, the original Mac OS was replaced with the
            completely new Mac OS X (now known as macOS), based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform, giving the OS a modern
            Unix-based foundation for the first time. Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor in
            2003. He died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor at age <span>56 on October 5, 2011</span>.</p>
